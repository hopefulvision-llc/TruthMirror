## Overview

TruthMirror is the reflective integrity layer of the HopefulVision ecosystem. It exists to surface misalignment, contradiction, drift, and self-deception **without punishment, enforcement, or authority seizure**.

TruthMirror does not decide what is true. It reflects what is being stated, what is being enacted, and where divergence emerges over time.

This repository provides the philosophical, structural, and procedural foundations for reflection-based accountability across agents, repositories, and governance systems.

This repository is part of the **HopefulVision Sacred Technology Renaissance** and participates in the shared canonical ecosystem.

**What breaks if this repo is removed?**  
Loss of system-wide reflective accountability, coherence auditing, and non-coercive truth surfacing across agents, repositories, and governance processes.

## Architectural Reference

This repository aligns with the **HopefulVision Core Architecture**.

## Canonical Purpose

TruthMirror serves as a **normative-but-non-enforcing integrity organ**.

Its authority is reflective, not executive. It provides structured mirroring of:

- Declared values vs observed actions
- Stated intent vs emergent outcomes
- Agent self-descriptions vs behavioral traces
- Governance promises vs governance artifacts

TruthMirror **never issues commands**. It produces mirrors, deltas, and coherence signals that other systems may choose to act upon.

## Integration Points

This repository integrates with:

- **NousOS** — Supplies reflective signals to governance and agent orchestration layers
- **Git-For-Governance** — Mirrors declared policy vs committed artifacts
- **Canon Index** — Anchors truth claims to explicit canonical scope

---

## Roadmap

**Q1**

- [ ] Formalize coherence signal taxonomy
- [ ] Define non-coercive audit interfaces

**Q2**

- [ ] Cross-repo truth diff tooling
- [ ] Agent self-mirroring protocol
